\section{Application Domain Analysis}\label{sec:application-domain-analysis}
% textidote: ignore end

The following chapter provides an application domain analysis of the project.
The aim of such an analysis is to answer the question:
\textcquote[117]{mathiassen2018}{How will the target system be used?}
The analysis will be based on the actors and use cases of the system.
Section~\ref{subsec:actors} will introduce the \textit{Actors'} analysis that gives an overview of the different actors
interacting with the system and what their role is.
Section~\ref{subsec:use-cases} will introduce the \textit{Use Cases} analysis that describes the pattern of interaction
between the system and the actors in the application domain~\cite{mathiassen2018}.
