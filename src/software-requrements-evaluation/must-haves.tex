\subsection{Must-haves}\label{subsec:must-haves}

In this section, we will evaluate the must-haves requirements.
Most of our must-haves have been implemented, and the system is functional.
That concerns uploading a csv file, creating a user, deleting a user, creating an order, getting a list of all orders
with a particular product ID and getting a list of all orders on a particular date.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Getting a list of all customers:}
    Although this requirement was a must-have, it has not been implemented.
    The reason for this is that the requirement was not prioritized as highly as the other must-haves.
    From the data we receive from the~\acrshort{epos} system, we do not have the information about the customers.
    Therefore, we did not prioritize this requirement as highly as the other must-haves.
    Even though this requirement was not implemented, the system is still functional without it and can be used by the
    company. % todo: A little too much yapping here, maybe?
    We have discussed this with the company, and they are aware that this requirement was not implemented.
    But they are still satisfied with the system and the functionality it provides.
\end{itemize}
