% textidote: ignore end

In this section, we will show the features of the back end, hereby showcase the most important functions,
the libraries used and the database integration.

The back end of an application can mean many things and can be of very different complexities.
For our solution, we have implemented a single Spring Boot application containing an HTTP server that handles all
relevant requests and responses.
We therefore only need a single container deployed for the back end.

The backend handles the model and controller part of the MVC architecture and is written in the Java programming
language.
The reasons for this choice are multiple:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Java has existed for a long time, why it has stood the test of time.
    For this reason, Java is also very well documented, which makes it easy to work with.
    \item Secondly, Java is widely used in the industry, why the team members get valuable experience and knowledge when
    working with the language.
    \item Lastly, it is heavily suggested by the university that the group uses the language for their P3 project.
\end{itemize}
