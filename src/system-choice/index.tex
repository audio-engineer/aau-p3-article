\chapter{System Choice}\label{ch:system-choice}
% textidote: ignore end

Whenever a new system is to be designed and created, the first step should always be to gain a deep understanding of the
current situation.

This chapter will start with an in-depth description of the current situation at NOVA Kaffe~\&~Vinbar in
Section~\ref{sec:the-current-situation}.
The issues and concerns that this description will outline will come together in a problem statement in
Section~\ref{sec:problem-statement} that attempts to summarize them.
Continuing on, Section~\ref{sec:cultivating-new-ideas} will present further investigation into the troubles of the caf√©,
while also presenting further requirements to the solution, and ideas for how to solve them.
The system definition in Section~\ref{sec:system-definition} will then summarize these ideas concisely, whose validity
will be inspected in Section~\ref{sec:factor-criterion}.
Finally, a~\acrfull{srs} will formalize the requirements as set by the client and categorized through the preceding
sections in this chapter.
