% textidote: ignore end

When creating a structured system, it is important to consider the design of the system.
The architectural design is the first step in the design process.
Section~\ref{subsec:criterion} will introduce the criteria that the group has chosen to focus on.
Then, Section~\ref{subsec:architecture} will introduce the architecture of the backend of the system.
Finally, Section~\ref{subsec:class-diagrams} will introduce the class diagrams of the whole system.
