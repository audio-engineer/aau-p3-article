% textidote: ignore end

In the implementation of the design, the client-server architecture is used~\cite{mathiassen2018}.
The most important element of the architecture is that the server can serve several clients.
In this architecture, Server Component and Client Component~\cite{mathiassen2018} are analogous to the `back end' and
`front end'.
Furthermore, the front end handles the view part of the MVC architecture.
The terms `back end' and `front end' will be used for a few reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most importantly, in modern front-end architecture, there are common optimization features that regard
    components that are rendered in the server rather than on the client.
    These are also called `server components', which is why using the term for both the front end and for the
    components of the front end would give rise to confusion.

    \item Secondly, in modern language, the terms `back end' and `front end' are more widely used.
    More readers will therefore have an easier time following the section if these are used.
\end{itemize}

In this section, some features of the front end will be displayed, hereby showcasing the most important functions,
components and some libraries used.
