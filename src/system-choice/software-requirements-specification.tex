\section{Software Requirements Specification}\label{sec:software-requirements-specification}

For further clarification and alignment of features to prioritize the MoSCoW model is employed~\cite{hudaib2018}.
Herein an overview of the requirements for the software is covered.
\textbf{``Must-haves''} (Mo) include features that must be included in the software for it to be functional.
\textbf{``Should-haves''} (S) include features that are desired and possible to implement, but are not prioritized as
highly as must-haves due to time limitations.
\textbf{``Could-haves''} (Co) include features that are possible and valuable to implement but are not the main
focus of the report.
\textbf{``Won't-haves''} (W) include features that are out of scope and won't be implemented.

Furthermore, the requirements are split into two different tables, functional- and non-functional requirements.
Functional requirements describe what actions the system must be capable of performing.
Non-functional requirements, however, describe how the system must function~\cite{benyon2019}.
This is done among other reasons to distinguish between functionality and quality attributes.
By having these separated into different tables, it is easier to plan design decisions and maintain a clear overview.
