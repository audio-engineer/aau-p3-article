\subsection{Final design}\label{subsec:final-design}

For the final design, the group went back to the hi-fi prototype and made some changes.
One requested change was to show more charts on the dashboard at the same time.
This was done by making the charts smaller and adding charts below each other.
The filter options are now a button instead to allow for more precise date filtering.
Finally, the navigation bar was moved from the top to the side of the page to allow for more space for the charts.
The bar is also collapsible if the user wants to focus on the charts.

The group took into consideration their target audience when designing the user interface.
The interface is minimalistic, and the colors are simple to appeal to the co-workers at the caf√© are mostly young
adults.
For gradient transitions, the group is using shades of blue, with darker shades representing higher values and lighter
shades representing lower values.
Blue was chosen as it contrasts well with its shades, which makes it easy to read the charts.
For variable colors, the group is using different colors that are easy to distinguish from each other.
An example of this can be seen in the bar chart, where the color of each bar is contrasting with the adjacent bars.
This was done to make it easier to distinguish between the different bars and to make the charts more accessible to
colorblind users.
