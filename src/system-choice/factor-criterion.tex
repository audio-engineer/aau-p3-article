\section{FACTOR Criterion}\label{sec:factor-criterion}
% textidote: ignore end

The FACTOR criterion is a more detailed breakdown of the system definition~\ref{sec:system-definition}.
It is divided into six categories, each representing a different aspect of the system.

\begin{tabular}{ m{2.5cm} m{10cm} }
    \toprule
    \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description} \\
    \midrule
    Functionality & The system should take the café's sales history as a comma-separated input data, and visualize it to
    help the user interpret the data and predict future sales. \\
    \midrule
    Application domain & The system will be used by the café's workers and managers, with the goal of getting an
    overview of the café's performance, and assist them with food preparation and employee management. \\
    \midrule
    Conditions & The system will be developed by a group of students from AAU for use in Nova, with the goal of solving
    their problem definition.
    As the system will be used by café workers, it must be user friendly. \\
    \midrule
    Technology & The system will be deployed on a cloud server, which can be accessed through a normal web browser.
    It will primarily be accessed through the cash register, which is a tablet in this case, so the design must be
    mobile first. \\
    \midrule
    Objects & A list of objects can be found in the Section~\ref{sec:classes-objects-and-structure} \\
    \midrule
    Responsibility & The app must assist the users in decision- making when it comes to preparing for the day.
    This includes an efficient management of employees, insuring that the busiest hours have enough employees, and
    that enough food is prepared for the day. \\
