The system could be improved by having a faster response time.
The system is currently already fast enough for the user to use, but it could always be improved.
One of the would-haves was to have a faster response time, but this was not prioritized.
One way to improve the response time could be to optimize the reading and writing of the data in the system.
The application could make asynchronous calls to reading the CSV files, which would make the system faster.
