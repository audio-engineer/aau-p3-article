\subsection{Front-End Framework}\label{subsec:front-end-framework}

For the frond end, the framework~\url{Next.js}~\cite{next2024} is used.
This choice is made for several reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item The group used the same framework in P2, why the advantages of familiarity apply.

    \item The framework is very well documented, which makes for easy troubleshooting and learning.

    \item The framework is in demand in the industry, why learning it and gaining experience in it is potentially useful
    for the future.
\end{itemize}

The~\url{Next.js} framework is a framework that builds on top of the React~\cite{react2024} JavaScript library.
React provides several features and functions that make developing components easy and efficient.
Even though it has some difficult to understand mechanics, it makes development significantly more fluent.

React, and in turn~\url{Next.js}, relies on~\url{Node.js}~\cite{node2024} to run.
\url{Node.js} is a JavaScript runtime that enables JavaScript to run on the server.
\url{Node.js's} package manager npm~\cite{npm2024} manages dependencies, compiles code and enables running
development servers, which provide an environment for testing and building applications locally.
