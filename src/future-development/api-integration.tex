The system could be more user-friendly if the system could be integrated with an API instead of uploading CSV files
manually to the system.
By having an API, the system would seamlessly update the data in the system, and the user would not have to upload
manually, making the system more automated and user-friendly.
The reason why this was not implemented is because of the~\acrshort{epos} system of the company, which does not provide
an API\@.
