% textidote: ignore end
The following chapter will provide an analysis of the application domain of the project.
The analysis will be based on the actors and use cases of the system.
Section~\ref{sec:actors} will introduce the \textit{Actors'} analysis that gives an overview of the different actors
interacting with the system and what their role is.
Section~\ref{sec:use-cases} will introduce the \textit{Use Cases} analysis that describes the pattern of interaction
between the system and the actors in the application domain~\cite{mathiassen2018}.
