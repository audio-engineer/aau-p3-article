As mentioned in the problem statement~\ref{subsec:problem-statement} we wanted to look into the effectiveness
of the loyalty program because having a loyalty program is a great way to increase customer retention and
engagement.
Loyalty programs are widely recognized as a powerful tool for increasing customer loyalty which leads to more visits,
boosting the overall business performance

However, during the project, our focus shifted towards the development of the application and its core features,
which were critical for ensuring its functionality and success.
As a result, we were unable to further investigate the loyalty program's effectiveness,
and it is not discussed further in this report.
