This chapter conducts a thorough analysis of NOVA's current operational system, which struggles with key challenges
such as the lack of detailed sales data and inefficiencies in staff allocation.
These issues hinder NOVA's ability to make informed decisions and optimize resources, impacting overall productivity
and growth.
