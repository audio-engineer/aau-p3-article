The following Section will describe the most important models in the system.
This is done to give a better understanding of the architecture, more specifically the business logic.

As seen in Figure~\ref{fig:model-diagram}, the model describes the repository layer.
This layer connects both to the csv handler, but also the database as it uses the models to persist data.
