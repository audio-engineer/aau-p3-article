An actor is a person, system, or external entity that interacts with the system~\cite{mathiassen2018}.
In this section, we will identify the actors that interact with the system and describe their roles and goals.

    \textbf{Goal:} The owners interact with the system to gain insights into the performance of their assets.
    And to make informed decisions based on the data provided.
    \newline

    \noindent
    \textbf{Characteristics:} The owners are the primary users of the system.
    The owners are experienced in managing day-to-day operations of the café, but they may not have extensive technical
    expertise.
    \newline

    \noindent
    \textbf{Examples:} One of the owners logs into the system on wednesday morning to prepare for the upcoming days.
    Their goal is to ensure that the café is well-staffed and that they have stocked up the right amount of baked goods
    for what they think will be a busy few days.
    Using the system, they can:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Check hourly sales data from the previous week to predict how many customers that will
        visit the café.
        \item Optimize the schedule of the employees based on the predicted number of customers.
        \item Analyze the product demand to ensure that they have enough baked goods in stock.
    \end{itemize}
