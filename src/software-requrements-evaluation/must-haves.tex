\subsection{Must-Haves}\label{subsec:must-haves}

In this section, the must-haves requirements are evaluated.
Most of the must-haves have been implemented, and the system is functional.
These include uploading a CSV file, creating a user, deleting a user, creating an order, getting a list of all orders
with a particular product ID and getting a list of all orders on a particular date.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Getting a list of all customers:}
    Although this requirement was a must-have, it has not been implemented.
    The reason for this is that the requirement was not prioritized as highly as the other must-haves.
    From the data the application receives from the~\acrshort{epos} system is not included information about the
    customers.
    Even though this requirement was not implemented, the system is still functional without it and can be used by the
    company.
    It has been discussed with the company, and they are aware that this requirement was not implemented.
    They are, however, still satisfied with the system and the functionality it provides.
\end{itemize}
