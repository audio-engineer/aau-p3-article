\section{The Current Situation}\label{sec:the-current-situation}

Several shortcomings from NOVA have been documented in the transcript below.
The most noticeable is the issues regarding the~\acrfull{epos} insights and how they are not elaborate enough in its
current state.

\blockquote[Paraphrased from an interview with Nancy, owner of NOVA]{As NOVA is a relatively new business, many minor as
well as major issues have to be solved.
We are lacking~\acrshort{bi} both because we are a new business, but also because our current~\acrshort{epos} does not
allow for sufficient insights into our data.

A consequence of this is that we do not know how effective our loyalty program is.
Moreover, the~\acrshort{epos} only provides sales data at a daily level and not an hourly level.
This makes for unnecessary difficulty understanding when throughout the day the business is most busy and thereby makes
it difficult to efficiently allocate human resources.
In addition, we do not know when in the day certain products are sold and thereby cannot effectively prepare said
products efficiently.

For us, the most important requirement of a potential solution is that it has to be user-friendly for all personnel ---
both technically and non-technically proficient.}
