\subsection{Criterion}\label{subsec:criterion}

The criterion is a list of requirements for the design of the system.
It shows the fields of the system that the group focuses on.
The specific criteria are taken from a list of standard criteria for software systems~\cite[180]{mathiassen2018}.

As seen in Table~\ref{tab:criterion}, the two most vital criteria for the system are that it is correct and usable.
The system must be correct because it must work as intended.
That means that the group has to fulfil all the requirements that they have set for the system.
The system must also be usable because the system is intended for caf√© workers that may not have experience with
analytical systems before.
Security, reliability, and comprehensibility are also important to the system.
Since the system is dealing with sensitive sales data, it is necessary that the system is secure.
It needs to be reliable because the system is intended to be used in a business setting, where the system must be
available when needed.
Comprehensibility is needed for the same reason as usability.

Maintainability, testability, and flexibility are less relevant because they are not directly related to the
functionality of the system.

The system is not efficient because the group is not looking to profit from the system.
Reusability, portability, and interoperability are also irrelevant because the system is not designed to be used by
other businesses.
