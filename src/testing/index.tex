Testing is an important part of production-grade code.
It allows the developers to check that parts of the code behave as expected.
The strictly correct implementation of code testing is~\acrfull{tdd}.
In software development~\acrshort{tdd}, is a method where one designs code around tests.
This also means that if one were to truly do~\acrshort{tdd}, one would design tests for all functionality
in one's program, and then make code to pass the given tests.
The authors deemed that extensive testing was not strictly needed for this project.
Time constraints were also considered.

Though~\acrshort{tdd} was not used for this project, there was still a need for testing.
It was decided that unit tests were going to be implemented with a focus on the back-end software, as
it is there most of the critical functionality is.
When creating unit tests, the authors decided to follow the~\acrfull{aaa} pattern, also called the Build Operate
Check pattern~\cite{clean-code}.
