\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:problem-statement}

When meeting the owners of the Caf\'e, they established that they wanted to have a system that could provide them with
an overview of their sales, so they could make better decisions based on their data.
The data provided by the system would help optimize staff shifts, ensuring that the right number of employees are
scheduled for the right time of day.

Additionally, the caf\'e sells baked goods that need to be prepared in advance.
The system should enable the owners to analyze the sales data provided to see the customer traffic from previous weeks,
ensuring they can prepare the right amount of baked goods for the upcoming days.

With one of the owners not being very tech-savvy, we would need to make sure that the system is easy to use and
understand, so it is critical that we focus on the UX of the system.

This presents us with the following problem statement:
\begin{tcolorbox}[title=Problem statement]
    How can we design an application that provides the caf\'e owners with a comprehensive overview of their sales and
    facilitates better decision-making based on the available data, while ensuring that the system is intuitive and
    accessible for all users?
