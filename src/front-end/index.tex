% textidote: ignore end

In the implementation of the design, we use the client-server architecture~\cite{mathiassen2018}.
The most important element of the architecture is that the server can serve several clients.
In this architecture, Server Component and Client Component~\cite{mathiassen2018} are analogous to the `back end' and
`front end'.
Furthermore, the front end handles the view part of the MVC architecture.
We will use the terms `back-end' and `front-end' for a few reasons:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Most importantly, in modern front end architecture, there are common optimization features that regard
    components that are rendered in the server rather than on the client.
    These are also called `server components' why using the term for both the front end and for the components of the
    front end would give rise to confusion.

    \item Secondly, in modern language, the terms `back-end' and `front-end' are more widely used.
    More readers will therefore have an easier time following the section if these are used.
\end{itemize}

In this section, we will show some features of the front end, hereby showcase the most important functions and
components and some libraries used.
