When deploying the application, several containers need cloud hosting to run.
There exist different solutions for cloud hosting, below are listed the ones we will use:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Vercel:}
    Vercel~\cite{vercel2024} is the company behind~\url{Next.js}, which is the front-end framework used for the
    application, which provides excellent deployment support and solutions for such applications.
    Vercelâ€™s free tier makes it an ideal choice for hosting the front-end.

    \item \textbf{\acrfull{aws}:}
    \acrshort{aws}~\cite{aws2024} has different hosting options.

    Their services support different hosting mechanisms, hereby enabling the hosting of the back-end application.
    The database will also be hosted, though with the service called RDS~\cite{rds2024}.
\end{itemize}

All deployment containers will use Ubuntu~\cite{ubuntu2024}.
This common industry choice is chosen for its consistency and reliability.
