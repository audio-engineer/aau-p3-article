\subsection{FACTOR Criterion}\label{subsec:factor-criterion}

The FACTOR criterion is a more detailed breakdown of the system definition in Section~\ref{subsec:system-definition}.
It is divided into six categories, each representing a different aspect of the system as seen in
Table~\ref{tab:factor-criterion}.

\begin{table}[H]
    \begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{ l X }
        \toprule
        \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Description}
        \\ \midrule
        Functionality
        & The system should take the café's sales history as a comma-separated input data, and visualize it to
        help the user interpret the data and predict future sales.
        \\ \midrule
        Application domain
        & The system will be used by the café's workers and managers, with the goal of getting an
        overview of the café's performance, and support them with food preparation and employee management.
        \\ \midrule
        Conditions
        & The system will be developed by a group of students from AAU for use in NOVA, with the goal of solving
        their problem definition.
        As the system will be used by café workers, it must be user-friendly.
        \\ \midrule
        Technology
        & The system will be deployed on a cloud server, which can be accessed through a normal web browser.
        It will primarily be accessed through the cash register, which is a tablet in this case, so the design must be
        mobile first.
        \\ \midrule
        Objects
        & A list of objects can be seen in the Section~\ref{subsec:classes-objects-and-structure}
        \\ \midrule
        Responsibility
        & The app must help users in decision-making when it comes to preparing for the day.
        This includes an efficient management of employees, insuring that the busiest hours have enough employees, and
        that enough food is prepared for the day.
