\section{Cultivating New Ideas}\label{sec:cultivating-new-ideas}

During the initial consultations with the client NOVA Kaffe~\&~Vinbar, the group gained insight into the problem as seen
from the client's perspective.
For the next stage of the process, the group set on to try to gain a deeper understanding of the situation by
understanding existing solutions, and brainstorming new ideas.

Whenever a new system is to be designed, it is crucial both to be able to objectively listen to the client and
understand the issue from their perspective.
Likewise, it is also crucial to understand whether any old, existing ideas have already solved the problem, since such
ideas could potentially be reused in the given situation.
Furthermore, new ideas need to be cultivated and evaluated in comparison to any existing solutions or ideas.
During this stage of the process, it is of vital importance to continuously brainstorm and evaluate ideas in
collaboration with the client, since, without such a collaboration, any prospective ideas might be too general or
abstract~\cite[32]{mathiassen2018}.

Therefore, the group conducted additional meetings with the client, where possible solutions were discussed.
One of the questions that the group asked the owners of NOVA was whether they were familiar with the Google Analytics
suite or Microsoft Power BI\@.
Both those pieces of software are extremely well-established in the industry and widely used, and can be categorized as
``old ideas'' that serve as \textit{exemplars}~\cite[33]{mathiassen2018} and form a potential solution for the problem.
Interestingly, the owners answered that they were familiar with the named software, but thought of it as either being
too complex to use, as in the case of Microsoft Power BI, or too general as Google Analytics.
Additionally, they expressed that neither of them had the necessary knowledge of data analysis or time to take care of
the prerequisite setup to be able to leverage the power of professional analysis software.
Rather, they hoped that a custom piece of software could be made with accessibility and user experience in mind —
tailored to their needs, so to speak.

Now that the usage of existing solutions was eliminated, at least directly using them, one of the next questions was
whether the client already had some preconception of what such a custom piece of software could look like.
The client answered that they use an Apple iPad for all the daily operations of the café such as ordering inventory,
receiving payments through the~\acrshort{epos} system, managing staff, etc., and that they would love to be able to use
the custom software on the iPad.
Another requirement was that the software would present the business data through easy-to-understand data visualizations
that don't require knowledge of data analysis concepts.
The latter requirement was of special importance, since it also became clear that the software would have to be used by
all café staff, including young baristas, so accessibility once again appeared as a determining factor in the
discussions.

Continuing on the topic of preconceived ideas, the owners of NOVA told the group that they were thinking that an iPad
application would be the perfect software solution.
The reasoning behind this idea goes back to the fact that all the café's operations happen on the iPad anyway, so simply
having an additional app would be the most efficient scenario.
Now, the group pointed out a couple of obstacles with this approach: Namely, creating a one-off custom tablet
application is unsustainable, since it requires permission from the Apple App Store to be able to deploy it on the
café's iPad.
Such a permission would come with a fee and additional legal requirements, which the client didn't consider when first
discussing this idea internally before the meeting with the group.
So the group proposed an alternative: The application could easily run in the iPad's web browser, as a web application.
The owners of NOVA saw this proposal as a good balance between using the existing iPad infrastructure and ordering a
software solution that is economical, realistic and maintainable.

To conclude, the following requirements were deducted from the client meetings:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Easy-to-understand user interface
    \item Data analyzed through visualizations
    \item Target device and technology: iPad browser
\end{itemize}
